# Development

These commands are used when working on the package itself:

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint        # eslint
npm test            # vitest
npm run build       # tsc -p tsconfig.build.json → dist/
```

## Local development / linking

If you consume this package via a local path (e.g. `"@rdlabo/workers-hono-kit": "../../hono-kit"`) rather than from npm, TypeScript and esbuild resolve the package's bare imports from *its own* `node_modules`, which can create a second `zod` instance. That breaks types where your zod-inferred values flow into other libraries (e.g. Drizzle inserts). Dedupe with tsconfig `paths`:

```jsonc
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "zod": ["node_modules/zod"],
      "zod/*": ["node_modules/zod/*"],
      "@hono/zod-validator": ["node_modules/@hono/zod-validator"]
    }
  }
}
```

When installed from npm normally, package managers dedupe `zod` to a single copy and this is not needed.

When developing against the kit via a direct `file:` link, run `npm install` in the kit repo itself to satisfy its peers (do not add `overrides` on the consumer side).
